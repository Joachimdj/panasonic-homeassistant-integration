    print("\n🔍 POSSIBLE CAUSES:")
    print("1. ❌ Real API methods not available on device object")
    print("2. ❌ API calls failing silently") 
    print("3. ❌ Coordinator refresh overwriting local changes")
    print("4. ❌ Wrong method names or parameters")
    print("5. ❌ Device object doesn't support temperature setting")
    
    print("\n🔧 DEBUGGING STEPS ADDED:")
    print("✅ Added extensive method debugging")
    print("✅ Added pending temperature cache") 
    print("✅ Prevented immediate refresh on API failure")
    print("✅ Extended API response wait time")
    print("✅ Added comprehensive error logging")
    
    print("\n🚀 TESTING APPROACH:")
    print("1. Set water heater temperature in Home Assistant")
    print("2. Check Home Assistant logs for debug output")
    print("3. Look for these specific log messages:")
    
    print("\n📋 KEY LOG MESSAGES TO LOOK FOR:")
    print("   🔍 'Device has X total methods, Y temp-related, Z set-related'")
    print("   🔍 'Temperature methods: [list]'")
    print("   🔍 'Set methods: [list]'")
    print("   🌐 'API SUCCESS: Set tank target temperature...' (if working)")
    print("   ❌ 'No temperature setting methods found on device' (if not working)")
    print("   💾 'Temperature cached locally...' (fallback activated)")
    
    print("\n🔬 WHAT TO CHECK IN LOGS:")
    print("1. Does device have any temperature-related methods?")
    print("2. Are any of these methods present:")
    print("   - set_tank_target_temperature")
    print("   - set_dhw_target_temperature") 
    print("   - set_temperature")
    print("   - tank.set_target_temperature")
    print("   - tank.set_temperature")
    
    print("\n🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES:")
    
    print("\nSCENARIO A - API Methods Available:")
    print("   ✅ Should see 'API SUCCESS' message")
    print("   ✅ Temperature should persist after refresh")
    print("   ✅ No reversion to old value")
    
    print("\nSCENARIO B - No API Methods (Current Issue):")
    print("   ❌ Will see 'No temperature setting methods found'")
    print("   💾 Temperature cached locally (immediate UI change)")
    print("   🔄 Will use cached value until real API available")
    print("   ❌ May still revert on some refreshes")
    
    print("\n🛠️  NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING:")
    print("1. Share the debug log output showing available methods")
    print("2. If no temp methods found: Need to find correct aioaquarea API")
    print("3. If methods found but failing: Need to debug method calls")
    print("4. If methods working: Success!")
    
    print("\n📝 HOW TO TEST:")
    print("1. Restart Home Assistant to load updated integration")
    print("2. Go to water heater entity in Home Assistant")
    print("3. Change temperature (e.g., from 50°C to 55°C)")
    print("4. Immediately check Home Assistant logs")
    print("5. Wait 30 seconds and check if temperature reverted")
    print("6. Share the debug output here")
    
    print("\n⚡ IMPROVED BEHAVIOR:")
    print("Even if API doesn't work, temperature should now:")
    print("   ✅ Stay changed longer (cached)")
    print("   ✅ Show better error messages")
    print("   ✅ Give more debugging information")
    print("   ✅ Not refresh immediately on failure")
